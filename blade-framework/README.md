In addition, several real-world applications are included such as several photonics problems.

### AlphaEvolve Benchmarks

BLADE bundles benchmark instances inspired by the Google DeepMind
AlphaEvolve paper. The ready-to-run reference scripts live in
[`run_benchmarks/`](./run_benchmarks), while the reusable benchmark
definitions are organized under [`iohblade/benchmarks`](./iohblade/benchmarks)
by domain (analysis, combinatorics, geometry, matrix multiplication, number
theory, packing, and Fourier). Each domain folder includes a short README that
summarizes the task and instances.

### Included Search Methods

The suite contains the state-of-the-art LLM-assisted search algorithms:

### Evaluating against Human Designed baselines

An important part of BLADE is the final evaluation of generated algorithms against state-of-the-art human designed algorithms.
In the `iohblade.baselines` part of the package, several well known SOTA black-box optimizers are imolemented to compare against.
Including but not limited to CMA-ES and DE variants.

For the final validation **BLADE** uses [**IOHprofiler**](https://iohprofiler.github.io/), providing detailed tracking and visualization of performance metrics.

## 🎁 Installation

It is the easiest to use BLADE from the pypi package (`iohblade`).

```bash
  pip install iohblade
```

> [!Important]
> The Python version **must** be larger or equal to Python 3.11.
> You need an OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama/Claude/DeepSeek API key for using LLM models.

You can also install the package from source using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" target="_blank">uv</a> (0.7.19).
make sure you have `uv` installed.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XAI-liacs/BLADE.git
   cd BLADE
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies via uv:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. _(Optional)_ Install additional packages:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group kerneltuner --group dev --group docs
   ```
   This will install additional dependencies for development and building documentation.
   The (experimental) auto-kernel application is also under a separate group for now.
4. _(Optional)_ Intall Support for MLX optimised LLMs:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group dev --group apple-silicon --prerelease=allow
   ```
   Select all the groups required, and append it with `--group apple-silicon --prerelease=allow`, to install
   libraries that enable MLX Optimised LLMs support through `mlx-lm` and `LMStudio`.

## 💻 Quick Start

1. Set up an API key for your preferred provider:

   - Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), Claude, Gemini, or another LLM provider.
   - Set the API key in your environment variables:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
     ```

2. Running an Experiment

   To run a benchmarking experiment using BLADE:

   ```python
   import os

   from iohblade.experiment import Experiment
   from iohblade.llm import Ollama_LLM
   from iohblade.methods import LLaMEA, RandomSearch
   from iohblade.problems import BBOB_SBOX
   from iohblade.loggers import ExperimentLogger

   llm = Ollama_LLM("qwen2.5-coder:14b") #qwen2.5-coder:14b, deepseek-coder-v2:16b
   budget = 50 #short budget for testing

   RS = RandomSearch(llm, budget=budget) #Random Search baseline
   LLaMEA_method = LLaMEA(llm, budget=budget, name="LLaMEA", n_parents=4, n_offspring=12, elitism=False) #LLamEA with 4,12 strategy
   methods = [RS, LLaMEA_method]

   problems = []
   # include all SBOX_COST functions with 5 instances for training and 10 for final validation as the benchmark problem.
   training_instances = [(f, i) for f in range(1,25) for i in range(1, 6)]
   test_instances = [(f, i) for f in range(1,25) for i in range(5, 16)]
   problems.append(BBOB_SBOX(training_instances=training_instances, test_instances=test_instances, dims=[5], budget_factor=2000, name=f"SBOX_COST"))
   # Set up the experiment object with 5 independent runs per method/problem. (in this case 1 problem)
   logger = ExperimentLogger("results/SBOX")
   experiment = Experiment(methods=methods, problems=problems, runs=5, show_stdout=True, exp_logger=logger) #normal run
   experiment() #run the experiment, all data is logged in the folder results/SBOX/
   ```

### Trackio logging

To mirror results to a [Trackio](https://github.com/gradio-app/trackio) dashboard,
install the optional dependency and use `TrackioExperimentLogger`:

```bash
uv sync --group trackio
```

```python
from iohblade.loggers import TrackioExperimentLogger

logger = TrackioExperimentLogger("my-project")
experiment = Experiment(methods=methods, problems=problems, runs=5, exp_logger=logger)
```

## 🌐 Webapp

After running experiments you can browse them using the built-in Streamlit app:

```bash
uv run iohblade-webapp
```

The app lists available experiments from the `results` directory, displays their progress, and shows convergence plots.
