**BLADE** is a Python framework for benchmarking the Llm Assisted Design and Evolution of algorithms.
**BLADE** (Benchmark suite for LLM-driven Automated Design and Evolution) provides a standardized benchmark suite for evaluating automatic algorithm design algorithms, particularly those generating metaheuristics by large language models (LLMs).
It focuses on **continuous black-box optimisation** and integrates a diverse set of **problems** and **methods**, facilitating fair and comprehensive benchmarking.

Evaluating against Human Designed Baselines
-------------------------------------------

An important part of BLADE is the final evaluation of generated algorithms against state-of-the-art human-designed algorithms. In the ``iohblade.baselines`` part of the package, several well-known SOTA black-box optimizers are implemented to compare against, including but not limited to CMA-ES and DE variants.

For the final validation, **BLADE** uses **IOHprofiler**, providing detailed tracking and visualization of performance metrics.
