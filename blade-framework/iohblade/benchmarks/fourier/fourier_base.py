    Base spec for the uncertainty inequality (Appendix B.4).

    and the test function is f(x) = P(x) * exp(-pi * x^2).
    The evaluator computes an upper bound on C4 as r_max^2 / (2*pi),

    Notes:
      - H_n are physicists' Hermite polynomials.

      - Scale invariance: multiply c by s>0 ⇒ same score.
